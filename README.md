**Katas**
is a personal repository for 'code-challenge' style problems from the online platform;
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com)

*From the website:* 
>"On the platform, software developers train on programming challenges known as kata. These discrete programming exercises train a range of skills in a variety of programming languages."

Katas range in varying levels of difficulty from '8kyu', all the way up to '1kyu', with 1kyu being the most challenging.
A new solution will be pushed to this repository every time that I have solved a new kata. As an extra challenge to myself, many of my solutions are written recursively. However, I do attempt to keep readability and maintainability in mind. Feel free to browse my solutions to gain an insight into my personal style of problem-solving!
